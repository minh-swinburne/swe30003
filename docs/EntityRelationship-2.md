# Question

this way will the User and VehicleType of Vehicle be automatically initialized / loaded, and we can use `vehicle.User`, or we have to set them manually?

---

# Answer

By default, **EF Core does not automatically load navigation properties** (`User` and `VehicleType`) unless you explicitly:
1. **Include them in the query (`.Include()`)**
2. **Enable lazy loading (not recommended for performance reasons)**

---

### **üîπ How to Load Navigation Properties**
Since you‚Äôre storing only `UserId` and `VehicleTypeId`, you **must load the `User` and `VehicleType` explicitly** if you need them.

#### **Option 1: Explicitly Include in Query**
This is the **recommended approach** for performance control:
```csharp
var vehicle = await _context.Vehicles
    .Include(v => v.User)       // Load User entity
    .Include(v => v.VehicleType) // Load VehicleType entity
    .FirstOrDefaultAsync(v => v.Id == vehicleId);
```
- Now, `vehicle.User` and `vehicle.VehicleType` are **automatically populated**.
- ‚úÖ **Recommended for API responses** when you need related data.

---

#### **Option 2: Lazy Loading (Not Recommended)**
EF Core supports **lazy loading**, meaning navigation properties (`User` and `VehicleType`) are fetched **when first accessed**. To enable it:
1. **Mark navigation properties as `virtual`**:
   ```csharp
   public virtual User? User { get; set; }
   public virtual VehicleType? VehicleType { get; set; }
   ```
2. **Install EF Core Proxies** (if not already enabled):
   ```shell
   dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Proxies
   ```
3. **Enable lazy loading in `DbContext`**:
   ```csharp
   services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(options =>
       options.UseLazyLoadingProxies().UseSqlServer(connectionString));
   ```
üí° Now, `vehicle.User` and `vehicle.VehicleType` will be **automatically fetched** from the database when first accessed:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine(vehicle.User.FirstName); // Triggers database query!
```
‚ùå **Not recommended for high-performance apps**, as it can lead to many unexpected database queries (N+1 problem).

---

### **üîπ When Should You Use Each Approach?**
| Approach | Pros | Cons | When to Use |
|----------|------|------|-------------|
| `.Include()` | Better performance, avoids extra queries | Must explicitly specify relationships | ‚úÖ Recommended for API calls when fetching multiple entities |
| Lazy Loading | Automatically fetches related data | Can lead to many unexpected queries (N+1 problem) | ‚ùå Avoid in performance-critical scenarios |

---

### **Final Takeaway**
If you need `vehicle.User` and `vehicle.VehicleType` **automatically populated**, use **`.Include()`** in your queries. Do **not** rely on lazy loading unless you really need it.
