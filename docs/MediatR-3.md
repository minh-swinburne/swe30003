# Question

I mean, if the event handlers are implemented in the Application layer like you recommend, will the mediatR of the Application layer mistakenly register it? If so how to ensure that they only register the correct handlers (by maybe excluding the namespace of event handlers), or can we just register it and not use (is there any potential harm)? And also, I think that these event handlers will mostly interact with external services (like notification, email...) instead of internal services, so wouldn't it make more sense if they are implemented in the Infrastructure layer?

# Answer

### **1. Will MediatR in the Application layer mistakenly register event handlers?**
Yes, if the event handlers are implemented in the **Application layer**, MediatR in the Application layer will register them because it scans all handlers in the assembly using `Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()`.

#### **Potential Issues**
- **Unnecessary Registration**: Event handlers meant for domain events (handled by the Infrastructure layer) will be registered in the Application layer, even though they won't be used there.
- **Confusion**: This could lead to confusion about which layer is responsible for handling domain events.

---

### **2. How to ensure MediatR only registers the correct handlers?**
You can control which handlers are registered by **filtering namespaces** or **scanning specific assemblies**.

#### **Option 1: Exclude Event Handlers by Namespace**
If your event handlers are in a specific namespace (e.g., `SmartRide.Application.Events.Handlers`), you can exclude them during registration in the Application layer:

```csharp
services.AddMediatR(cfg =>
{
    cfg.RegisterServicesFromAssembly(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly(), type =>
        !type.Namespace!.StartsWith("SmartRide.Application.Events.Handlers"));
});
```

This ensures that only request handlers (e.g., CQRS handlers) are registered in the Application layer.

---

#### **Option 2: Use Explicit Assembly Scanning**
Instead of scanning the entire assembly, you can explicitly register handlers from specific namespaces or assemblies.

For example, in the Application layer:
```csharp
services.AddMediatR(cfg =>
{
    cfg.RegisterServicesFromAssembly(typeof(SomeCQRSHandler).Assembly); // Register only CQRS handlers
});
```

In the Infrastructure layer:
```csharp
services.AddMediatR(cfg =>
{
    cfg.RegisterServicesFromAssembly(typeof(SomeEventHandler).Assembly); // Register only event handlers
});
```

---

### **3. Can we just register the event handlers in the Application layer and not use them?**
Yes, you can register the event handlers in the Application layer and not use them. However, this is not ideal:
- **Performance Overhead**: MediatR will still resolve these handlers during runtime, even if they are not invoked.
- **Code Clarity**: It may confuse developers about the purpose and location of the handlers.

---

### **4. Should event handlers be implemented in the Infrastructure layer?**
Yes, it can make sense to implement event handlers in the **Infrastructure layer** if they primarily interact with external services (e.g., sending emails, notifications, logging). Here's why:
- **Infrastructure Responsibilities**: The Infrastructure layer is responsible for external integrations, so placing handlers here aligns with the **Single Responsibility Principle**.
- **Separation of Concerns**: This keeps the Application layer focused on orchestrating business logic and internal workflows.

#### **When to Place Event Handlers in the Infrastructure Layer**
- The handler interacts with external systems (e.g., email services, SMS gateways, third-party APIs).
- The handler performs infrastructure-specific tasks (e.g., logging, file storage).

---

### **5. How to implement event handlers in the Infrastructure layer?**
If you decide to implement event handlers in the Infrastructure layer:
1. **Define the Event in the Domain Layer**:
   - Keep the event definition in the Domain layer to avoid breaking Clean Architecture.
   ```csharp
   public record UserCreatedEvent(User User) : INotification;
   ```

2. **Implement the Handler in the Infrastructure Layer**:
   - Place the handler in the Infrastructure layer and implement `INotificationHandler<T>`.
   ```csharp
   public class UserCreatedEventHandler : INotificationHandler<UserCreatedEvent>
   {
       private readonly IEmailService _emailService;

       public UserCreatedEventHandler(IEmailService emailService)
       {
           _emailService = emailService;
       }

       public async Task Handle(UserCreatedEvent notification, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
       {
           var user = notification.User;
           await _emailService.SendAsync(user.Email, "Welcome!", "Thank you for registering.");
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Register MediatR in the Infrastructure Layer**:
   - Ensure the Infrastructure layer registers its own handlers:
     ```csharp
     services.AddMediatR(cfg => cfg.RegisterServicesFromAssembly(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()));
     ```

---

### **6. Summary**
- **Event Handlers in the Application Layer**:
  - If implemented here, filter namespaces during MediatR registration to avoid registering domain event handlers unnecessarily.
  - Use this approach if the handlers primarily interact with internal services or orchestrate workflows.

- **Event Handlers in the Infrastructure Layer**:
  - This is a better choice if the handlers interact with external services (e.g., email, notifications).
  - Register MediatR in the Infrastructure layer to handle these events.

- **Best Practice**:
  - Keep **event definitions** in the Domain layer.
  - Place **event handlers** in the layer that aligns with their responsibilities:
    - **Application layer** for internal workflows.
    - **Infrastructure layer** for external integrations.
