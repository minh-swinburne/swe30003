# Question

This system is required to allow payment in cash or digital, and I'm wondering whether the Strategy design pattern (or another better one) can be applied here. If so, how would it be implemented (in which layers, to both connect to external services for digital payment and to use it in application logic) and happen?

# Answer

Yes! The **Strategy Pattern** is a great fit for handling multiple payment methods (cash & digital) in your ORSP system. Letâ€™s break down how to implement it.

---

## **Why Use the Strategy Pattern?**

The **Strategy Pattern** allows you to define a family of payment methods (cash, credit card, PayPal, etc.), encapsulate them in separate classes, and switch between them dynamically.

âœ…  **Flexibility** : Add or change payment methods without modifying core logic.

âœ…  **Encapsulation** : Each payment method has its own implementation.

âœ…  **Open/Closed Principle** : Easily extendable for new payment providers.

---

## **How to Implement Strategy Pattern for Payments**

### **1. Define the Strategy Interface**

```csharp
public interface IPaymentStrategy
{
    Task<bool> ProcessPayment(decimal amount, string currency);
}
```

### **2. Implement Concrete Strategies**

#### **Cash Payment Strategy**

```csharp
public class CashPaymentStrategy : IPaymentStrategy
{
    public async Task<bool> ProcessPayment(decimal amount, string currency)
    {
        // Log cash payment confirmation (no external service needed)
        Console.WriteLine($"Cash payment of {amount} {currency} received.");
        return await Task.FromResult(true);
    }
}
```

#### **Credit Card Payment Strategy**

```csharp
public class CreditCardPaymentStrategy : IPaymentStrategy
{
    private readonly IExternalPaymentGateway _paymentGateway;

    public CreditCardPaymentStrategy(IExternalPaymentGateway paymentGateway)
    {
        _paymentGateway = paymentGateway;
    }

    public async Task<bool> ProcessPayment(decimal amount, string currency)
    {
        return await _paymentGateway.ProcessTransaction(amount, currency);
    }
}
```

#### **PayPal Payment Strategy**

```csharp
public class PayPalPaymentStrategy : IPaymentStrategy
{
    private readonly IExternalPaymentGateway _paymentGateway;

    public PayPalPaymentStrategy(IExternalPaymentGateway paymentGateway)
    {
        _paymentGateway = paymentGateway;
    }

    public async Task<bool> ProcessPayment(decimal amount, string currency)
    {
        return await _paymentGateway.ProcessTransaction(amount, currency);
    }
}
```

---

## **3. Implement the Payment Context**

```csharp
public class PaymentProcessor
{
    private IPaymentStrategy _paymentStrategy;

    public void SetPaymentStrategy(IPaymentStrategy paymentStrategy)
    {
        _paymentStrategy = paymentStrategy;
    }

    public async Task<bool> ExecutePayment(decimal amount, string currency)
    {
        if (_paymentStrategy == null) throw new InvalidOperationException("Payment strategy not set.");
        return await _paymentStrategy.ProcessPayment(amount, currency);
    }
}
```

---

## **4. Integrate in Application Logic**

### **Dependency Injection Setup (in `Infrastructure` Layer)**

```csharp
services.AddScoped<IPaymentStrategy, CashPaymentStrategy>();
services.AddScoped<IPaymentStrategy, CreditCardPaymentStrategy>();
services.AddScoped<IPaymentStrategy, PayPalPaymentStrategy>();
services.AddScoped<PaymentProcessor>();
services.AddScoped<IExternalPaymentGateway, ExternalPaymentGateway>(); // For digital payments
```

### **Service Layer (`PaymentService`)**

```csharp
public class PaymentService
{
    private readonly PaymentProcessor _paymentProcessor;
    private readonly IServiceProvider _serviceProvider;

    public PaymentService(PaymentProcessor paymentProcessor, IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
    {
        _paymentProcessor = paymentProcessor;
        _serviceProvider = serviceProvider;
    }

    public async Task<bool> ProcessRidePayment(string method, decimal amount, string currency)
    {
        IPaymentStrategy? strategy = method switch
        {
            "Cash" => _serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<CashPaymentStrategy>(),
            "CreditCard" => _serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<CreditCardPaymentStrategy>(),
            "PayPal" => _serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<PayPalPaymentStrategy>(),
            _ => throw new ArgumentException("Invalid payment method")
        };

        _paymentProcessor.SetPaymentStrategy(strategy);
        return await _paymentProcessor.ExecutePayment(amount, currency);
    }
}
```

---

## **5. Controller to Trigger Payments**

```csharp
[HttpPost("pay")]
public async Task<IActionResult> PayForRide([FromBody] PaymentRequestDto paymentDto)
{
    bool success = await _paymentService.ProcessRidePayment(paymentDto.Method, paymentDto.Amount, paymentDto.Currency);
    return success ? Ok("Payment successful") : BadRequest("Payment failed");
}
```

---

## **6. Where Does This Fit in Your Layers?**

* **Controllers** â†’ Call `PaymentService`
* **Service Layer** â†’ Selects the payment strategy
* **Infrastructure Layer** â†’ Implements external payment gateways
* **Domain Layer** â†’ Defines the `IPaymentStrategy` interface

---

## **7. What About Event-Driven Architecture?**

For  **real-time ride tracking and payments** , consider **message brokers** (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka):

* If a driver accepts a ride,  **send an event** : `"RideAccepted"`.
* Payment service listens to `"RideCompleted"` events â†’ triggers payment processing.

---

## **8. Does Redis Need to Be Updated for Payments?**

If you cache ride statuses in Redis, you might:

1. **Invalidate the cache** when payment succeeds (`Cache.Remove(rideId)`).
2. **Store payment status in Redis** (`Cache.Set(rideId, "Paid")`).

---

## **Final Takeaways**

âœ” **Strategy Pattern** allows switching between payment methods dynamically.

âœ” **Service Layer** selects the correct strategy and processes payments.

âœ” **Infrastructure Layer** connects to external payment gateways.

âœ” **Event-driven approach** can make payment processing  **asynchronous & scalable** .

âœ” **Redis caching** can be used for ride and payment statuses.
