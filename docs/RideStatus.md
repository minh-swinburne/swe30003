# Question

Can and should I apply the State design pattern in this system? Like for the ride status, the system may behave differently when:

- Driver applying to a ride: matches driver with ride if "pending", fail if "picking" (another driver has been matched a bit sooner).
- Passenger wanting to cancel a ride: there will be slight differences based on the current ride status ("pending", "picking", or "travelling")
- etc.
  But I'm not sure if this is a good idea, partly because the ride status itself is an entity in the Domain layer, and the logic will mostly be implemented in the handlers / services.

# Answer

Yes, applying the **State design pattern** to manage ride statuses is a great idea for your ORSP system! It allows  **each ride status to encapsulate its own behavior** , reducing `if-else` chains and improving maintainability.

---

## **1. Why Use the State Pattern for Ride Status?**

üöÄ **Benefits:**

‚úî  **Encapsulates ride status logic** : Avoids scattered `if` conditions across services.

‚úî  **Improves maintainability** : New statuses can be added with minimal changes.

‚úî  **Enhances domain-driven design (DDD)** : Keeps ride behavior within its status.

üö® **Potential Downsides:**

* Might add **complexity** if there are too few behaviors per status.
* Extra abstraction might not be necessary for very simple transitions.

**‚û° Best for:** A system with multiple distinct ride behaviors per status (like yours).

## **2. How to Implement State Pattern for Ride Status**

Each **ride status** will be an object that **determines what happens** in different situations.

### **Step 1: Define the Ride State Interface**

```csharp
public interface IRideState
{
    void ApplyDriver(Ride ride, Driver driver);
    void CancelRide(Ride ride, Passenger passenger);
    void CompleteRide(Ride ride);
}
```

---

### **Step 2: Implement Different Ride States**

Each ride state **defines its own logic** for various operations.

#### **Pending State (Passengers Can Cancel, Drivers Can Apply)**

```csharp
public class PendingState : IRideState
{
    public void ApplyDriver(Ride ride, Driver driver)
    {
        ride.Driver = driver;
        ride.SetState(new PickingState()); // Transition to next state
    }

    public void CancelRide(Ride ride, Passenger passenger)
    {
        ride.SetState(new CancelledState());
    }

    public void CompleteRide(Ride ride)
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Cannot complete ride before starting.");
    }
}
```

#### **Picking State (Passengers Can Cancel, Drivers Cannot Apply)**

```csharp
public class PickingState : IRideState
{
    public void ApplyDriver(Ride ride, Driver driver)
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Ride already has a driver.");
    }

    public void CancelRide(Ride ride, Passenger passenger)
    {
        ride.SetState(new CancelledState());
    }

    public void CompleteRide(Ride ride)
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Ride not yet started.");
    }
}
```

#### **Travelling State (Passenger Cannot Cancel, Ride Can Be Completed)**

```csharp
public class TravellingState : IRideState
{
    public void ApplyDriver(Ride ride, Driver driver)
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Cannot change driver while ride is in progress.");
    }

    public void CancelRide(Ride ride, Passenger passenger)
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Cannot cancel an ongoing ride.");
    }

    public void CompleteRide(Ride ride)
    {
        ride.SetState(new CompletedState());
    }
}
```

---

### **Step 3: Modify the `Ride` Entity to Use the State Pattern**

```csharp
public class Ride
{
    public IRideState State { get; private set; }

    public Ride()
    {
        State = new PendingState(); // Default state
    }

    public void SetState(IRideState newState)
    {
        State = newState;
    }

    public void ApplyDriver(Driver driver) => State.ApplyDriver(this, driver);
    public void CancelRide(Passenger passenger) => State.CancelRide(this, passenger);
    public void CompleteRide() => State.CompleteRide(this);
}
```

---

## **3. Where Does This Fit in the ORSP System?**

### **Domain Layer:**

* The **Ride entity** has a `State` field that  **controls behavior** .
* Each ride state is **self-contained** in how it handles actions.

### **Application Layer:**

* Services and handlers **delegate ride operations** to the `Ride.State`.

**Example: Handler for Driver Applying to a Ride**

```csharp
public class ApplyDriverHandler : IRequestHandler<ApplyDriverCommand>
{
    private readonly IRepository<Ride> _rideRepository;

    public ApplyDriverHandler(IRepository<Ride> rideRepository)
    {
        _rideRepository = rideRepository;
    }

    public async Task Handle(ApplyDriverCommand request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var ride = await _rideRepository.GetByIdAsync(request.RideId);
        if (ride == null) throw new NotFoundException("Ride not found.");

        ride.ApplyDriver(request.Driver);
        await _rideRepository.UpdateAsync(ride);
    }
}
```

---

## **4. Alternative Approaches**

üí° **Without the State Pattern, you'd typically have:**

```csharp
public void ApplyDriver(Ride ride, Driver driver)
{
    if (ride.Status == RideStatus.Pending)
    {
        ride.Driver = driver;
        ride.Status = RideStatus.Picking;
    }
    else
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Cannot apply for ride in this state.");
    }
}
```

‚ùå **Downsides of This Approach:**

* `if-else` conditions scattered across services.
* More difficult to add new ride statuses later.
* Harder to test and maintain.

---

## **5. When NOT to Use the State Pattern**

üö´ If the status changes  **do not significantly affect behavior** , a simple **enum** might be sufficient:

```csharp
public enum RideStatus
{
    Pending,
    Picking,
    Travelling,
    Completed,
    Cancelled
}
```

If logic per status is minimal (just updating the DB), **a switch statement** inside a service might be simpler.

---

## **6. Conclusion: Should You Use the State Pattern?**

‚úÖ **YES, because:**

‚úî Ride behavior changes significantly per status.

‚úî It aligns well with  **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** .

‚úî It makes the system **extensible** and  **testable** .
