# Question

What role do the commands and queries play in this system (clean architecture with CQRS and repository pattern)? We can simply call repository for CRUD operations...

# Answer

Collecting workspace informationIn this system, commands and queries play a crucial role in implementing **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** and adhering to **Clean Architecture** principles. Here's why they are used instead of directly calling repositories:

### **1. Separation of Concerns**
- **Commands** handle **write operations** (e.g., creating, updating, deleting data).
- **Queries** handle **read operations** (e.g., fetching data).
- This separation ensures that the system is **modular** and **easier to maintain**.

### **2. Decoupling Business Logic from Data Access**
- Commands and queries encapsulate **business logic** and **use cases**.
- Repositories are responsible only for **data access**, while commands/queries ensure that the **business rules** are applied before interacting with the repository.

For example:
- A `CreateUserCommand` might validate the input, hash the password, and then call the repository to save the user.
- A `ListUserQuery` might apply filters, sorting, and pagination logic before fetching data from the repository.

### **3. Mediator Pattern for Loose Coupling**
- Commands and queries are sent through **MediatR**, which acts as a **mediator** to route requests to their respective handlers.
- This decouples the **service layer** (e.g., `UserService`) from the **implementation details** of the handlers and repositories.

### **4. Scalability and Extensibility**
- Commands and queries allow for **additional processing** (e.g., logging, validation, caching) without modifying the repository or service.
- For example, a `ListUserQueryHandler` can add caching for frequently accessed data, while a `CreateUserCommandHandler` can trigger domain events after saving the user.

### **5. Adherence to Clean Architecture**
- In Clean Architecture:
  - The **Application Layer** (commands/queries) depends on **abstractions** (e.g., `IRepository`), not concrete implementations.
  - The **Infrastructure Layer** (repositories) implements these abstractions.
- This ensures that the **core business logic** is independent of the database or other external systems.

### **Why Not Call Repositories Directly?**
Directly calling repositories from the service layer would:
1. **Violate Separation of Concerns**: The service would mix business logic with data access logic.
2. **Tightly Couple Layers**: The service would depend directly on the repository, making it harder to test or replace the repository.
3. **Reduce Flexibility**: Adding cross-cutting concerns (e.g., validation, logging) would require modifying the service or repository, leading to less modular code.

### **Conclusion**
Commands and queries are essential for maintaining a **clean, scalable, and testable architecture**. They ensure that the system adheres to CQRS principles, separates concerns, and decouples business logic from data access.
