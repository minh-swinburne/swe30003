# Question

Should I use a separate Id field for pk (current approach as it inherits from BaseEntity which defines Id of type Guid), or just use national ID as PK? The similar concern for Vehicle, should I just use Vin for pk?

# Answer

### **Should You Use a Separate `Id` Field or National ID / VIN as Primary Key?**

#### **For `Identity` (National ID vs. Separate `Id`)**

‚úÖ **Use a separate `Id` (GUID)** (Recommended)

‚ùå **Do not use National ID as the Primary Key**

**Why?**

1. **National ID is not guaranteed to be unique** across different countries.
   * Some countries may allow duplicate or recycled national IDs.
   * Expats may have multiple national IDs.
2. **Changing national IDs is possible** (due to legal corrections, government policies, etc.).
   * If National ID is the primary key, updates become a **headache** due to cascading changes.
3. **Consistency with the rest of the system**
   * All entities inherit from `BaseEntity`, which already defines `Id` as a `GUID`.
   * Keeping the same pattern ensures **predictable** behavior across all entities.

üí° **Final Decision for `Identity`:**

* ‚úÖ **Use a separate `Id` (GUID) as the primary key**
* ‚úÖ **Store `NationalId` as a unique column with a unique constraint**

**Example in EF Core:**

```csharp
public class Identity : Entity
{
    public string NationalId { get; set; }  // Unique constraint
}
modelBuilder.Entity<Identity>()
    .HasIndex(i => i.NationalId)
    .IsUnique();
```

#### **For `Vehicle` (VIN vs. Separate `Id`)**

‚úÖ **Use a separate `Id` (GUID)**

‚ùå **Do not use VIN as the Primary Key**

**Why?**

1. **VIN may not always be available** when registering a vehicle.
   * Some vehicles might **not have** VINs (e.g., older vehicles, special-use vehicles).
   * In some cases, the VIN might be **pending** due to regulatory or manufacturer delays.
2. **VIN changes due to errors or corrections**
   * If a VIN is entered incorrectly and needs to be updated, it would be **painful** to update if it's the PK.
   * Using `Id` as PK allows **safe corrections** without breaking relationships.
3. **Consistency with other entities**
   * Using `GUID` for `Id` makes querying and indexing **faster and more efficient** than using long alphanumeric VINs.

üí° **Final Decision for `Vehicle`:**

* ‚úÖ **Use a separate `Id` (GUID) as the primary key**
* ‚úÖ **Store `VIN` as a unique column with a unique constraint**

**Example in EF Core:**

```csharp
public class Vehicle : Entity
{
    public string Vin { get; set; }  // Unique constraint
}
modelBuilder.Entity<Vehicle>()
    .HasIndex(v => v.Vin)
    .IsUnique();
```

### **Summary of Best Practices**

| Entity   | Primary Key (PK) | Unique Constraint |
| -------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Identity | `Id`(GUID)     | `NationalId`    |
| Vehicle  | `Id`(GUID)     | `VIN`           |

üöÄ  **Final Verdict** :

* ‚úÖ **Use a separate `Id` (GUID) as the PK** for both `Identity` and `Vehicle`.
* ‚úÖ **Add unique constraints on `NationalId` and `VIN`** to prevent duplicates.
* ‚úÖ **This ensures flexibility, better data integrity, and consistency.**

Would you like to enforce these constraints at the database level or handle them programmatically as well? üöÄ
