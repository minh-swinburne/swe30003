# Question

I created this enum:

```csharp
namespace SmartRide.Domain.Enums;

public enum SexEnum
{
    Male = 1,
    Female = 2,
    Other = 3,
}
```

Should the Identity entity and table in db store it as string or int? If int then do I have to create a separate table for Sex (lookup table, to align to NF)

# Answer

### **Should `SexEnum` Be Stored as a String or an Int in the Database?**

‚úÖ **Store it as an `int`** (recommended).

**Why?**

* Enums are internally represented as integers in C#, so storing them as `int` improves **performance** and reduces  **storage size** .
* If you store it as a `string`, queries and indexing on `SexEnum` fields will be  **slower and take up more space** .

---

### **Do You Need a Lookup Table for `SexEnum`?**

‚ùå **No, a separate lookup table is unnecessary.**

* `SexEnum` is a small, **static** list of predefined values (Male, Female, Other).
* Creating a lookup table makes sense only if the list  **needs to be extended or modified dynamically** , which isn't the case here.
* **Normalization (NF)** is beneficial when values are updated frequently, but enums **do not change** in most applications.

**Example of the `Identity` table with an `int` enum mapping:**

```csharp
public class Identity
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string LegalName { get; set; }
    public SexEnum Sex { get; set; }  // Stored as an int in DB
}
```

**EF Core Mapping (if using Fluent API):**

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<Identity>()
        .Property(i => i.Sex)
        .HasConversion<int>(); // Ensures enum is stored as an int
}
```

---

### **Alternative: Storing Enum as a String (Less Recommended)**

If you really need human-readable values in the database, you can store it as a `string`:

```csharp
modelBuilder.Entity<Identity>()
    .Property(i => i.Sex)
    .HasConversion<string>(); // Enum stored as string (e.g., "Male", "Female")
```

üö´ Downsides: **Takes more storage space, makes queries less efficient, and is prone to typos.**

---

### **Final Verdict**

1. ‚úÖ Store `SexEnum` as an `int` in the database.
2. ‚úÖ  **No need for a lookup table** , since the values are static.
3. ‚úÖ Use `.HasConversion<int>()` in EF Core to ensure proper mapping.
