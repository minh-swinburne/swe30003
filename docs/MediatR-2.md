# Question

Note that both the Application layer and the Infrastructure layer are using mediatR now, but for different uses:
- For Application layer, mediatR is used to handle requests and requests handlers for CQRS.
- For Infrastructure layer, mediatR is used to handle domain events (defined in the Domain layer) and their handlers.
So, would it be confusing if I implement the event handlers in the Application layer? Would the mediatR of the Application layer incorrectly register it as well, and would the mediatR of the Infrastructure be able to register it (different projects)? What does `Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()` represent, the assembly of where the code lies in (Application / Infrastructure layer) or the program that executes the code (Presentation layer)?

# Answer

### **1. Would it be confusing to implement event handlers in the Application layer?**
No, it is not confusing to implement event handlers in the **Application layer**. In fact, this is a common practice in **Clean Architecture**. Here's why:
- **Separation of Concerns**: The **Domain layer** defines the events, while the **Application layer** handles them. This keeps the **Infrastructure layer** focused on persistence and external integrations.
- **Business Logic**: Event handlers often contain business logic or orchestrate workflows, which aligns with the responsibilities of the **Application layer**.

However, you need to ensure that the **MediatR registration in the Application layer** does not conflict with the **MediatR registration in the Infrastructure layer**.

### **2. Will MediatR in the Application layer incorrectly register event handlers?**
No, MediatR in the Application layer will not incorrectly register event handlers from the Infrastructure layer, as long as you are scanning the correct assemblies.

- **`Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()`** in the Application layer will only scan and register handlers defined in the Application layer.
- Similarly, **`Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()`** in the Infrastructure layer will only scan and register handlers defined in the Infrastructure layer.

This ensures that each layer registers only the handlers relevant to it.

---

### **3. Will MediatR in the Infrastructure layer register event handlers in the Application layer?**
No, MediatR in the Infrastructure layer will not register event handlers from the Application layer unless you explicitly scan the Application layer's assembly. Since you are using `Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()` in both layers, each MediatR instance will only scan and register handlers in its own assembly.

If you want the Infrastructure layer to handle domain events but the handlers are implemented in the Application layer, you need to explicitly scan the Application layer's assembly in the Infrastructure layer's `DependencyInjection` class.

Example:
```csharp
services.AddMediatR(cfg =>
{
    cfg.RegisterServicesFromAssembly(typeof(Application.DependencyInjection).Assembly); // Application layer
    cfg.RegisterServicesFromAssembly(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()); // Infrastructure layer
});
```

---

### **4. What does `Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()` represent?**
`Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()` refers to the assembly where the code is currently being executed. In the context of your `DependencyInjection` classes:
- In the **Application layer**, it refers to the `SmartRide.Application` assembly.
- In the **Infrastructure layer**, it refers to the `SmartRide.Infrastructure` assembly.

It does **not** refer to the program that executes the code (e.g., the Presentation layer). If you want to refer to a specific assembly, you can use `typeof(SomeClass).Assembly`, where `SomeClass` is a type defined in the desired assembly.

---

### **5. How to ensure proper registration of event handlers across layers?**
To avoid confusion and ensure proper registration:
1. **Domain Events in the Domain Layer**:
   - Define domain events in the **Domain layer** (e.g., `UserCreatedEvent`, `VehicleCreatedEvent`).

2. **Event Handlers in the Application Layer**:
   - Implement event handlers in the **Application layer** (e.g., `UserCreatedEventHandler`).
   - Ensure the Application layer's `DependencyInjection` class registers only request handlers and validators.

3. **Register Application Handlers in the Infrastructure Layer**:
   - If the Infrastructure layer is responsible for publishing domain events, it should also register the Application layer's event handlers:
     ```csharp
     services.AddMediatR(cfg =>
     {
         cfg.RegisterServicesFromAssembly(typeof(Application.DependencyInjection).Assembly); // Application layer
         cfg.RegisterServicesFromAssembly(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()); // Infrastructure layer
     });
     ```

4. **Avoid Duplicate Registrations**:
   - Ensure that the Application layer's MediatR registration does not scan the Infrastructure layer's assembly, and vice versa.

---

### **6. Summary**
- **Event Handlers in Application Layer**: This is the recommended approach in Clean Architecture.
- **MediatR Registration**:
  - Use `Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()` to scan handlers in the current layer.
  - Explicitly scan the Application layer's assembly in the Infrastructure layer if needed.
- **No Conflicts**: MediatR in the Application and Infrastructure layers will not conflict as long as they scan their respective assemblies.
- **`Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()`**: Refers to the assembly where the code is being executed (e.g., `SmartRide.Application` or `SmartRide.Infrastructure`).

By following these practices, you can ensure that domain events and their handlers are properly registered and executed without breaking the principles of Clean Architecture.
