# Question

1. Should I use sync or async operations of dbcontext? What is the difference, and the effect to .NET server?
2. Should the repository save changes after every operation, or should this be called explicitly in the context where it's used (like in service, where many different operations are involved by possibly different repos)?
3. What should the create, update and delete methods of repository return? I start to think that it shouldn't actually be the entity

Collecting workspace information1. **Should I use sync or async operations of DbContext?**

   You should prefer **async operations** (`SaveChangesAsync`, `FindAsync`, etc.) over synchronous ones in most cases, especially in a **.NET server environment**. Here's why:

   - **Async Benefits**:
     - **Non-blocking**: Async operations free up the thread to handle other requests while waiting for I/O operations (e.g., database queries) to complete.
     - **Scalability**: Increases the server's ability to handle more concurrent requests, as threads are not blocked.
     - **Best Practice**: Modern .NET applications, especially web APIs, are designed to leverage async/await for better performance.

   - **Sync Drawbacks**:
     - **Thread Blocking**: Synchronous operations block the thread, reducing the server's ability to handle concurrent requests.
     - **Potential Deadlocks**: Mixing sync and async code can lead to deadlocks in certain scenarios.

   **Effect on .NET Server**:
   Using async operations improves the scalability and responsiveness of your server, especially under high load. For example, in a web API, async operations allow the server to handle more requests simultaneously.

2. **Should the repository save changes after every operation?**

   It depends on your application's design, but in most cases, **repositories should not call `SaveChanges` automatically**. Instead, the **unit of work** (e.g., a service layer or a higher-level orchestrator) should manage when changes are saved. Here's why:

   - **Flexibility**: In many scenarios, you may need to perform multiple operations (e.g., create, update, delete) across different repositories as part of a single transaction. Automatically saving changes after each operation would make it harder to manage transactions.
   - **Performance**: Saving changes after every operation can result in multiple database round-trips, which is inefficient. Instead, batching changes and saving them once reduces overhead.
   - **Consistency**: Explicitly calling `SaveChanges` ensures that all changes are committed together, maintaining consistency.

   **Recommendation**:
   - Remove `SaveChangesAsync` from repository methods.
   - Call `SaveChangesAsync` explicitly in the service layer or wherever the repository is used.

3. **What should the create, update, and delete methods of the repository return?**

   Returning the entity itself is not always ideal. Here are some considerations:

   - **Create**:
     - Return the **ID** of the created entity (e.g., `Guid` or `int`).
     - Alternatively, return the entity if you need to include additional information (e.g., auto-generated fields like `Id` or `CreatedAt`).

   - **Update**:
     - Return a **boolean** indicating success (`true` for success, `false` for failure).
     - Alternatively, return the updated entity if the caller needs to see the changes.

   - **Delete**:
     - Return a **boolean** indicating success.
     - Alternatively, return the deleted entity if the caller needs to know what was deleted.

   **Recommendation**:
   - Use **value types** (e.g., `bool`, `Guid`, `int`) for simple operations.
   - Return the entity only if the caller explicitly needs it.

   Example:
   ```csharp
   public async Task<Guid> CreateAsync(T entity, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
   {
       await _dbSet.AddAsync(entity, cancellationToken);
       return entity.Id; // Return the ID instead of the entity
   }

   public async Task<bool> UpdateAsync(T entity, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
   {
       _dbSet.Update(entity);
       return true; // Indicate success
   }

   public async Task<bool> DeleteAsync(Guid id, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
   {
       var entity = await _dbSet.FindAsync(id, cancellationToken);
       if (entity == null) return false;

       _dbSet.Remove(entity);
       return true; // Indicate success
   }
   ```
