# Question

1. Suppose I want to return the whole entity like currently. Is my approach correct? I have a feeling that what I return isn't the "updated" entity, but rather an old version of it.
2. Are there async versions of update and delete? it's giving warnings because I'm not using `await` ðŸ˜…

# Answer

1. **Returning the whole entity:**

   Your current approach of returning the entity in `CreateAsync`, `UpdateAsync`, and `DeleteAsync` is **technically correct**, but there are some nuances to consider:

   - **CreateAsync**: The returned entity will include any database-generated fields (e.g., `Id`, timestamps) after the `AddAsync` operation. This is fine.
   - **UpdateAsync**: The entity you return is the same one passed to the method. However, if the database modifies any fields (e.g., triggers, computed columns), those changes will not be reflected in the returned entity unless you explicitly reload it from the database.
   - **DeleteAsync**: The returned entity is the one retrieved from the database before deletion. This is fine, as it represents the state of the entity before it was removed.

   **Potential Issue with UpdateAsync**:
   If you want to ensure the returned entity reflects the latest state from the database (e.g., after triggers or computed columns are applied), you should reload it after saving changes. For example:
   ```csharp
   public async Task<T> UpdateAsync(T entity, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
   {
       _dbSet.Update(entity);
       await _dbContext.SaveChangesAsync(cancellationToken); // Ensure changes are saved
       await _dbContext.Entry(entity).ReloadAsync(cancellationToken); // Reload the entity
       return entity;
   }
   ```

   However, this adds an extra database query, so only do this if necessary.

2. **Async versions of Update and Delete:**

   There are **no async versions** of `Update` or `Remove` in Entity Framework Core because these operations are performed in memory and do not involve I/O. The warnings you see are because you're using `async` methods but not `await`ing anything in those methods.

   To resolve the warnings, you can either:
   - **Remove the `async` keyword** and return a `Task` directly:
     ```csharp
     public Task<T> UpdateAsync(T entity, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
     {
         _dbSet.Update(entity);
         return Task.FromResult(entity);
     }

     public async Task<T> DeleteAsync(Guid id, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
     {
         var entity = await _dbSet.FindAsync(new object[] { id }, cancellationToken)
             ?? throw new KeyNotFoundException($"Entity of type {typeof(T)} with id {id} not found.");

         _dbSet.Remove(entity);
         return Task.FromResult(entity);
     }
     ```
   - **Keep the `async` keyword** and include a call to `SaveChangesAsync`:
     ```csharp
     public async Task<T> UpdateAsync(T entity, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
     {
         _dbSet.Update(entity);
         await _dbContext.SaveChangesAsync(cancellationToken); // Save changes to the database
         return entity;
     }

     public async Task<T> DeleteAsync(Guid id, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
     {
         var entity = await _dbSet.FindAsync(new object[] { id }, cancellationToken)
             ?? throw new KeyNotFoundException($"Entity of type {typeof(T)} with id {id} not found.");

         _dbSet.Remove(entity);
         await _dbContext.SaveChangesAsync(cancellationToken); // Save changes to the database
         return entity;
     }
     ```

   **Recommendation**:
   - If you want to keep `SaveChanges` responsibility outside the repository (e.g., in a service layer), use the first approach.
   - If you want the repository to handle saving changes, use the second approach.
