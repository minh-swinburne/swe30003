# Question

My current approach to implement service layer pattern, repository pattern, MediatR and CQRS:

- Controllers receive requests as DTOs and call relevant services.
- Services map DTOs to commands / queries and and send to mediatR handlers.
- Handlers interact with repositories.
  So what I'm wondering is:
- Should the handlers be only concerned with CRUD operations, and the services will be where different domain models interact? or should it happen right in handlers (in that case what will be the role of services)? And so will each controller have their own service (will there be controllers that use multiple services)?
- Is this the mediator design pattern? if so explain how it's applied.
- Is this correctly CQRS?

# Answer

Your current approach is well-structured and aligns with best practices in **Clean Architecture** using  **CQRS** ,  **MediatR** , and  **Service Layer Pattern** . Letâ€™s break it down:

---

## **1. Should Handlers Only Be Concerned with CRUD?**

### **Two Options for Handling Business Logic:**

âœ… **Option 1: Handlers Only for CRUD (Recommended for Large Systems)**

* **Handlers** : Perform **only** database operations (via repositories).
* **Services** : Contain **business logic** (interactions between domain models).
* This follows **Separation of Concerns** and makes it easier to  **unit test business logic** .

âœ… **Option 2: Handlers Contain Business Logic**

* **Handlers** : Handle  **both business logic and data access** .
* No need for a separate  **Service Layer** , making it **simpler** for small projects.
* But handlers may **become too large** if business logic grows.

### **Best Choice for ORSP (Ride-Sharing Platform)**

Your ORSP involves **complex business logic** (e.g., matching drivers, fare calculations, ride tracking), so:

âœ” **Keep handlers focused on CRUD.**

âœ” **Put business logic inside Services.**

## **2. Will Each Controller Have Its Own Service?**

### **Controller â†’ Service â†’ MediatR â†’ Handler â†’ Repository**

* **Most controllers will use a single service** , but some may use multiple services  **if multiple domains interact** .
* Example in ORSP:
  * **RideController** â†’ `RideService` (handles ride booking, assignment, etc.).
  * **PaymentController** â†’ `PaymentService`.
  * **AdminController** may need both `RideService` and `PaymentService` for admin reports.

---

## **3. Is This the Mediator Pattern?**

Yes! **MediatR is an implementation of the Mediator Design Pattern** in .NET.

### **How the Mediator Pattern Works in Your System:**

* **Controller calls Service** â†’ Service sends command/query to `IMediator`.
* **MediatR routes the request** to the right  **Handler** .
* **Handlers execute logic & return results** (by using repositories).

âœ… This **decouples controllers from repositories** and keeps them clean.

âœ…  **Controllers donâ€™t need to know the logic** â€”they just delegate requests.

---

## **4. Is This Correctly CQRS?**

Yes! Your approach follows  **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** :

âœ”  **Commands (Write Operations)** :

* `BookRideCommand` â†’ `BookRideHandler`
* `CompleteRideCommand` â†’ `CompleteRideHandler`

âœ”  **Queries (Read Operations)** :

* `GetRideDetailsQuery` â†’ `GetRideDetailsHandler`
* `GetDriverEarningsQuery` â†’ `GetDriverEarningsHandler`

âœ… **Separation of Commands & Queries** prevents unintended side effects.

âœ… Works well with **Redis caching** (cache read queries but execute write commands on DB).

âœ… Scales well when combined with **event-driven architecture** (e.g., RabbitMQ for ride updates).

---

## **Final Summary**

* âœ… Handlers should focus on  **CRUD** , and services handle  **business logic** .
* âœ… Each controller typically has  **one main service** , but some may use multiple.
* âœ… Your approach **follows the Mediator Pattern** (MediatR routes commands/queries).
* âœ… Your approach **is valid CQRS** (commands modify, queries only read).
